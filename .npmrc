# This option was added when we upgraded to NodeJS 16.x. NPM used to install
# peerDependencies by default but that's not the case any more. NPM modules
# must name specific versions of their peerDependencies. When we already have
# a peerDependency installed but not with a version names by the module then
# NPM will throw an error. Setting this option reverts it to the way it was.
